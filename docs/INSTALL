REQUIREMENTS:

--- at least PHP 4.1.x, with mysql support
--- MySQL
--- Webserver
--- Javascript enabled web browser


TESTED:

--- PHP 5.2.6 with mysql support
--- MySQL 5.0.67
--- Apache 2.2.9
--- Konqueror 3.5.10 Firefox 3.0.3

Any version of mysql or webserver software that supports php, whether it's an earlier
version than what's tested or later, will probably work fine. Any web browser that supports
CSS 2 should work fine (IE5+, Mozilla 1.0+, Firefox).

INSTALLATION:

New Install
-----------
--- Unpack the distribution into your webserver's document root directory.
--- Create a database named "phptimeclock" or whatever you wish to name it.
--- Create a mysql user named "timeclock" (or whatever you wish to name it) with a password.
    Give this user at least SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, ALTER, and CREATE privileges to ONLY
    this database.
--- Import the tables using the create_tables.sql script included in this distribution.
--- Edit config.inc.php using any changes you wish.
--- Open the index page with your web browser.
--- Click on the Administration link on the right side of the page. Input "admin" (without the quotes)
    for the username and "admin" (without the quotes) for the password. Please change the password
    for this admin user after the initial setup of PHP Timeclock is complete.
--- Create at least one office by clicking on the Create Office link on the left side of the page.
    You MUST create an office to achieve the desired results. Create more offices if needed.
--- Create at least one group by clicking on the Create Group link on the left side of the page.
    You MUST create a group to achieve the desired results. Create more groups if needed.
--- Add your users by clicking on the Create New Users link, and assign them to the office(s) and
    group(s) you created above. Give Sys Admin level access for users who will administrate
    PHP Timeclock. Give Time Admin level access for users who will need to edit users' time, but
    who will not need Sys Admin level access. If you require the reports to be secured so only
    certain users can run them, then give these users reports level access.

    *** Admin level access and reports level access are completely separate from each other. Just
    *** because a user has admin level access does not give that user reports level access. You must
    *** specifically give them reports level access when you are creating or editing the users,
    *** if you choose to secure these reports for these users. To make PHP Timeclock lock down the
    *** reports to only these users, set the use_reports_password setting in config.inc.php to "yes".

Upgrading from 1.05 to 1.1
